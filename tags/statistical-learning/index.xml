      <description>Word Segmentation
In this project we are looking at how infants are able to find words in continuous speech. Words in speech aren’t separated by blank spaces the way words in text are separated by blank spaces. If you think about what it’s like listening to a foreign language, one of the things that you might be able to recall is that it often sounds like people are speaking really really quickly.</description>

      <description>In this project, we examine detectability and learnability of vowel harmony patterns by infants and adults:
1) Vowel harmony (VH) and word segmentation (Does VH support word segmentation?) 2) VH and statistical learning (combining and colliding statistical and vowel harmonic cues) 3) VH and memory (Infants&amp;rsquo; and adults’ memories for harmonic and disharmonic word sequences) 4) VH and word learning (Does VH support learning of word-object associations?) 5) VH and non-adjacent dependency learning</description>
