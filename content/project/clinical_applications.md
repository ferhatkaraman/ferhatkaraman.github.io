In this project, we examine detectability and learnability of vowel harmony patterns by infants and adults:

1)	Vowel harmony (VH) and word segmentation (Does VH support word segmentation?)
2)	VH and statistical learning (combining and colliding statistical and vowel harmonic cues)
3)	VH and memory (Infants' and adultsâ€™ memories for harmonic and disharmonic word sequences)
4)	VH and word learning (Does VH support learning of word-object associations?)
5)	VH and non-adjacent dependency learning
